# Getting Started

## Windows

The easiest way to try out Avalonia is to install the Visual Studio Extension.

This will add a Avalonia project template and a Window template to the standard Visual Studo “Add” dialog (yes, icons still to come :) ):

## OSX / Linux

It is a little more manual on non-Windows platforms, but using Xamarin Studio you can install the Avalonia NuGet package.
