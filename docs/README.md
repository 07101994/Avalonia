## Building

Unzip the latest [docfx release](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/releases))
into a folder called `docfx` (this folder is .gitignored).

Create the `_site` documentation folder by running the build script:

```
build.cmd
```

To browse the `_site` documentation folder run the serve script:

```
serve.cmd
```

And you can view the generated website in your browser `http://localhost:8080`.
